(start a system for tracking things like locate dumps)

(Here's the deal, it should look at all the files on all the
 systems, and figure out which one's have not been backed up on
 other systems.  It should have the option for encryption, and
 also be able to reason with disasters, i.e. a fire might take
 out two servers, so backing up between them isn't enough, a
 flood might take out a region, etc.)

(add some of the parts of conspiracy reasoning to this)

(look into cleversafe / CMU PDL software)

(develop plans for recovery from various problems, such as raid
 disk failure, raid unsyncing, single hard drive loss, accidental
 deletion, vius, etc.)
